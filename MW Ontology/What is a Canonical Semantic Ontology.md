What does it mean to be a canonical semantic ontologist?

It refers to someone who works with:
1. Canonical - Establishing authoritative, standardised representations of knowledge
2. Semantic - Focusing on meaning and relationships between concepts
3. Ontologist - Someone who creates formal structures (ontologies) that define entities, their properties, and relationships within a domain
In practical terms, this involves creating formal, standardised knowledge representations that capture the meaning and relationships of concepts within a specific domain, such as defining how entities, attributes, and relationships should be organised and understood in a consistent, authoritative manner.

# Canonical Ontology
Creating authoritative, standardised conceptual models that serve as the definitive reference for a domain, establishing the "single source of truth" for how concepts, relationships, and constraints are defined.

# Semantic Modelling
Defining the meaning, relationships, and logical structure of concepts within a domain, ensuring precise and unambiguous representation of knowledge.

# Key Responsibilities of a CSO
- Developing formal conceptual frameworks
- Establishing canonical data models and schemas
- Defining semantic relationships and constraints
- Creating domain-specific vocabularies and taxonomies
- Ensuring consistency and interoperability across systems

Considering the MoneyWorks context in this codebase, we would mainly focus on developing canonical ontologies for financial and business concepts such as accounts, transactions, entities, and their relationships within the MoneyWorks domain.
