# **Comparing VAPI vs Twilio AI Voice Agents (Latency & South African Support)**

  

## **Twilio’s AI Voice Agent (ConversationRelay + OpenAI) – Overview**

  

Twilio’s conversational AI offering, **ConversationRelay**, enables developers to build natural voice agents on Twilio’s cloud telephony platform . Under the hood, Twilio integrates **OpenAI’s real-time GPT-4** model (via the Realtime API) to power the agent’s dialogue, along with Twilio’s Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. The focus is on making AI-driven calls feel _human-like_ – addressing pacing, tone, and interruption handling . In practice, this means the AI voice won’t have long awkward pauses and can handle barge-in (if a caller interrupts, the agent can stop talking promptly). Twilio’s platform orchestrates the whole pipeline (voice input → STT → LLM response → TTS → voice output) so that developers don’t need to stitch together multiple vendors .

  

**Latency and Responsiveness:** With the OpenAI integration, Twilio emphasizes _real-time_ interactions. The GPT-4 model streams its responses, allowing the agent to begin speaking answers as they are generated (rather than waiting for a full text) . This streaming approach, combined with advanced speech recognition, is intended to minimize latency so conversations flow naturally. While Twilio hasn’t published exact round-trip latency numbers, the goal is to achieve human-like responsiveness. In Twilio’s SIGNAL 2025 keynote, ConversationRelay was highlighted for features like interruption handling and _natural conversational pacing_ to remove unnatural delays . In short, Twilio’s recent improvements aim to drastically reduce the lag traditionally associated with IVR bots.

  

**Speech Recognition and TTS (South African Support):** Twilio’s voice agent lets you plug in top-tier STT/TTS engines. Natively, Twilio supports 119 languages/dialects for speech recognition and has partnered with providers like Google and Deepgram for high-accuracy models . In fact, Twilio’s _Gather_ and ConversationRelay can use **Deepgram’s Nova model or Google’s enhanced models** for STT , which improves understanding of accented English. (Deepgram is known for handling South African English accents well .) On the TTS side, Twilio offers a range of voices including **English (South African)**. For example, Twilio’s TTS voice roster includes _Amazon Polly’s “Ayanda”_, a female voice with a South African accent . This means an AI agent on Twilio can _speak_ in a local South African English voice, enhancing realism for that audience. In summary, Twilio can **recognize** South African English (using advanced models) and **speak** it with a natural accent (via Polly or other integrated TTS engines) . Beyond English, Twilio supports many languages – but since we’re prioritizing South African English, it’s important that Twilio covers that well (it does).

  

**Key Features:** Twilio’s solution is highly integrated with its telephony services. It can initiate outbound calls or handle inbound calls on Twilio phone numbers, then run the AI dialog. Twilio’s ConversationRelay provides a WebSocket interface – you connect your AI logic (or use OpenAI via Twilio) and Twilio streams audio back-and-forth . The platform also supports “bring your own” AI components: you can choose your own LLM (if not OpenAI’s) and even custom STT/TTS if needed . For example, developers can plug in ElevenLabs for ultra-realistic TTS or Deepgram for STT on Twilio . This flexibility ensures you’re not limited to Twilio’s default voices or models if those don’t perform best for your dialect.

  

Finally, Twilio has real-world momentum behind its AI Voice Agent: for instance, healthcare fintech Cedar deployed a Twilio-powered voice agent (“Kora”) and expects it to handle ~30% of inbound billing calls by end of 2025 . This suggests Twilio’s solution is production-ready and can deliver cost savings at scale.

  

## **VAPI.ai Voice Agents – Overview**

  

**VAPI** (from _vapi.ai_) is a dedicated infrastructure platform for real-time voice AI agents. In essence, VAPI provides the tooling to build, test, and deploy phone-based AI assistants that _listen_, _think (LLM)_, and _talk_ in natural language. A major selling point of VAPI is its focus on **ultra-low latency** interactions. The platform boasts _“sub-500ms latency”_ for voice agent responses , which is exceptionally fast – aiming to make AI conversations feel as responsive as talking to a human.

  

How does VAPI achieve this? It uses an optimized tech stack combining best-in-class components. For example, VAPI leverages **Daily.co’s global WebRTC network** for audio transport . Daily’s infrastructure is tuned for real-time media with very low jitter and an average ~13ms first-hop latency worldwide . This ensures the user’s speech reaches VAPI’s cloud quickly. Next, VAPI employs **fast speech-to-text**: by default they use Deepgram’s speech recognition, which can transcribe speech in under ~300ms . (Deepgram’s accuracy and speed are part of why VAPI can be so responsive.) With a quick transcript in hand, VAPI feeds it into an LLM (like GPT-4 or a model of your choice) and _streams out a reply_. The text is then converted to speech via TTS. Thanks to streaming, the AI can begin _speaking_ an answer before the user has even finished their sentence in some cases. All these optimizations lead to that sub-500ms interaction goal . In short, **VAPI’s pipeline is highly optimized for speed**: minimal network latency, rapid transcription, and immediate TTS output.

  

**Latency in Practice:** In a pure VoIP/WebRTC scenario, VAPI’s agents have near-instantaneous response time – user reports show “near-zero” latency for web-based calls . However, when connecting through certain telephony carriers, additional lag can appear. Notably, one developer observed that **using Twilio’s PSTN to connect to VAPI introduced significant latency**, to the point of feeling unnatural . Callers grew frustrated by the delay. The VAPI team recommended steps like optimizing Twilio’s speech settings (e.g. shorter end-of-speech timeouts), using Twilio Interconnect (a private network peering with Twilio), and ensuring regional proximity of servers . This highlights an important point: **VAPI itself is very fast, but real-world latency depends on the telephony path**. A direct IP/WebRTC call into VAPI is ideal; going through a third-party PSTN provider may add  latency unless carefully optimized. In the context of South Africa, this means you’d want to use a high-quality, local telephony route into VAPI (more on that below) to keep delays low.

  

**Speech & Language Support (South Africa):** VAPI is language-agnostic and _multilingual by design_. It advertises support for **100+ languages** for its voice agents . You are not tied to a single STT or TTS engine – in fact, **“bring your own models”** is a core feature . This means you can plug in the APIs or keys for whatever speech recognition and synthesis work best for your use case. For South African English, you have several options. For STT, you could use Deepgram (as VAPI’s default) which has proven accurate with South African accents (Deepgram’s tech was used to handle **11 different English dialects in South Africa** for a banking voicebot, after training on local accent data ). Alternatively, you might choose Google Cloud STT with the en-ZA model, or even a specialized local ASR model if available. VAPI will accommodate any of these – you just configure the API keys. Similarly for TTS, you could choose a voice that has a South African accent. For instance, you could plug in Amazon Polly’s _Ayanda_ voice (the same one Twilio offers) or a Google Cloud Wavenet voice for en-ZA. VAPI also integrates with cutting-edge TTS like ElevenLabs or PlayHT if you need a very natural voice . In summary, **VAPI can definitely handle South African English**: it gives you the flexibility to select the STT/TTS engines that are optimized for that dialect. If other South African languages (Zulu, Afrikaans, etc.) are needed, you could integrate providers that support those as well – but since our focus is English, it’s mostly about accent. VAPI’s _multilingual_ capability and custom model support mean you can fine-tune the system for **South African users specifically**.

  

**Development and Features:** Using VAPI requires a bit of engineering setup but offers powerful features. You can start with templates or build an agent workflow from scratch. The platform provides testing tools (even automated simulation to catch LLM hallucinations before deployment) . VAPI also supports “tool calling” – meaning your agent can call external APIs to perform actions or fetch data during a call . This is similar in concept to Twilio’s ability to integrate with your backend during a conversation. One notable feature: **VAPI truly encourages bring-your-own everything** – your own LLM (API key for OpenAI, etc., or even a self-hosted model), your own STT, your own TTS . This means if an _“OpenAI real-time optimized LLM”_ is desired (as you mentioned), you can directly use it with VAPI. For example, you could use OpenAI’s streaming GPT-4 via API, just like Twilio does, but perhaps choose a lighter model if you need faster responses for simple FAQs. VAPI acts as the glue and real-time audio manager for whichever AI components you bring.

  

## **Latency: VAPI vs Twilio in Comparison**

  

Both platforms are aiming for _real-time conversational latency_, but **VAPI has a reputation for lower latency** out-of-the-box. VAPI’s infrastructure is explicitly tuned to achieve responses in a few hundred milliseconds, and they advertise that figure (sub-0.5s) prominently . Twilio’s ConversationRelay, thanks to streaming and improvements, likely also operates in the sub-second range, but Twilio tends to describe it qualitatively (“real-time”, “human-like”) rather than commit to a specific ms number publicly.

  

**In practice**, users have noted differences. As cited earlier, a VAPI user found calls via Twilio had _“not human like”_ delay , whereas direct web calls to VAPI were fine. This suggests that Twilio’s telephony routing and possibly its media processing were introducing a noticeable lag. Twilio’s advice (use Interconnect, tune timeouts, etc.) implies that it’s possible to get decent latency with some optimizations, but it might require enterprise-level networking or configuration . On the other hand, if you use Twilio’s own AI agent **entirely within Twilio’s ecosystem**, Twilio can likely manage latency well. Twilio has the advantage of controlling the full stack (call routing + media + AI) within their cloud. The OpenAI integration streams responses so that the speech can start playing with minimal delay . Additionally, Twilio’s platform now supports “Advanced” speech recognition that presumably uses partial results for faster turn-taking (for example, Deepgram’s API can send interim transcripts very quickly, which Twilio could leverage when configured) . Twilio also co-locates media servers in various regions, and interestingly they have a presence in South Africa (“Twilio-ZA”, see below) which can cut down voice transit time.

  

**Bottom line on latency:** If every millisecond counts, **VAPI’s specialized pipeline is hard to beat**. It was essentially built to squeeze out latency, and community feedback backs up its low-lag performance (when not hindered by external factors). Twilio’s AI agent is _close_ and certainly much faster than legacy IVRs, but might still have a bit more overhead. That said, Twilio’s focus on _natural pacing_ may mitigate perceivable latency – e.g. the agent might fill small silences with a breathing sound or “umm” to feel more human rather than leaving a dead air gap (Twilio mentioned features to make conversations feel seamless) . In a sales call context, a gap of 200ms vs 500ms might not be very perceptible to the user if handled gracefully. Both platforms strive for real-time interaction, but **VAPI has the edge in raw technical latency**, whereas **Twilio leverages conversation design (and integration convenience) to hide latency**.

  

For your specific use case – **outbound calling a hot lead** to have a dynamic sales conversation – latency can be critical. Any delay in responding can make the call feel robotic or frustrating to the person on the line. VAPI’s sub-500ms target is a big plus here . Twilio, with proper tuning (using the fastest STT model and maybe tweaking the AI response length), should also be able to maintain a fluid conversation. It might come down to testing both in a realistic scenario. One approach some have taken is using VAPI as the “brain” while still leveraging Twilio’s telephony – but as we saw, that can create latency issues unless optimized. A better approach might be to use VAPI with a more direct SIP trunk (bypassing Twilio for the audio path) to keep latency low, _or_ use Twilio’s all-in-one solution and accept slightly higher latency for the convenience.

  

## **Support for South African English (STT/TTS)**

  

Both Twilio and VAPI can **handle South African English** – but they do so in slightly different ways:

- **Twilio:** Offers built-in support for _English (South Africa)_ in both recognition and speech. Twilio’s speech recognition can be set to the en-ZA locale (or you let it auto-detect accent). Moreover, Twilio now allows developers to pick advanced models specifically known for accuracy – e.g., you could choose **Deepgram’s STT** via Twilio for handling the South African accent . Deepgram’s success with SA accents (from the Elerian case study) indicates it’s a strong choice . On the TTS side, Twilio’s <Say> and <Play> features include voices that speak with a South African accent. As mentioned, **Polly “Ayanda”** is available (female, SA English) in neural quality . Twilio’s docs also show an “Aria” voice under en-ZA (likely Microsoft’s voice) , giving you potentially multiple voice options. In short, with Twilio you can have the AI talk in a genuine South African accent and understand local pronunciations and slang fairly well. If needed, Twilio could even integrate other languages common in SA (for example, support for Afrikaans or Zulu via Google’s STT) – but for this project you indicated **English-only**, which Twilio handles out-of-the-box.
    
- **VAPI:** Does not have “built-in” voices or languages per se – instead it lets you integrate whichever services you prefer. Upon creating a VAPI voice agent, you can specify which STT engine to use and which TTS voice to use. **For South African English, you have flexibility:** you might use the same Deepgram STT (with a custom model tuned to SA accent) since VAPI already partners with Deepgram . Or you could use Google’s STT with language code en-ZA for transcription. VAPI even allows _real-time translation_ if needed (but in our case we just need English understanding). For TTS, you would choose a voice from a provider: e.g., integrate Amazon Polly and request the “Ayanda” voice for all outputs, or use Microsoft Azure’s neural voices (Azure has **Afrikaans voices and might have an English SA voice** as well). Another interesting route: **ElevenLabs or Play.ht** have very natural-sounding voices and some can be tuned to an accent. ElevenLabs, for example, can clone voices or generate speech with a specified accent – one could potentially create a custom SA-accented voice if desired. VAPI supports ElevenLabs integration, as noted in its documentation . So, VAPI can absolutely speak South African English – it’s up to you to pick the voice that suits your brand and is intelligible to your audience.
    

  

In summary, **both platforms can be configured to work optimally for South African English callers**. Twilio gives you a ready-to-go selection of languages and even uses updated speech models (Google/Deepgram) under the hood for improved accuracy . VAPI gives you maximum control to choose the engines; it may require a bit more setup (obtaining API keys for Polly or Google, etc., and plugging them in), but it ensures you can use the _best_ available STT/TTS for the dialect. Notably, _Deepgram’s success in SA_ means that using VAPI (with Deepgram) or Twilio (with Deepgram) will likely yield good recognition performance in understanding local accents and terminology. The **nuance of accent and dialect** (e.g., slight differences in South African English vocabulary or pronunciation) can be handled by training or tuning. Deepgram allows custom acoustic models with additional audio training – something Elerian AI did to capture various dialects across SA’s 11 official languages. If your project demands _the absolute best_ in understanding South African speakers (perhaps across ethnic/regional accent variations), investing in such custom models via Deepgram (and using it through VAPI or Twilio) could be worthwhile. For **most applications, though, the default models are quite good** – English ASR from big providers has improved a lot for global accents.

  

## **Telephony in South Africa: Availability and Cost (Can I bring my own SIP trunk?)**

  

**Does it work in South Africa?** – Yes, both Twilio and VAPI can be used in South Africa, but let’s break down the details:

- **Twilio in South Africa:** Twilio has phone number coverage in South Africa (you can buy local SA phone numbers through Twilio for voice, both local and mobile numbers) . Twilio recently (as of 2024/2025) has improved its infrastructure in the region. Notably, Twilio offers localized call routing (“**Twilio-ZA**”) which drastically lowers the cost of outbound calls within South Africa. For example, calling a South African number from Twilio’s platform can cost **$0.4725/min** via a generic route, but only **$0.0270/min** if using the _Twilio-ZA local route_ . That is a huge difference – roughly 47 cents vs 2.7 cents USD per minute – which suggests Twilio now has a point-of-presence or carrier partner in South Africa to terminate calls cheaply . The pricing sheet shows similar disparity for mobile: $0.3570 vs $0.0450 . The upshot is, Twilio _can_ be cost-effective in SA if you ensure your calls use the local trunk (likely by using a Twilio South African phone number as the caller ID or by having a Twilio account in that region). Twilio’s **inbound call** pricing is also reasonable: $0.01/min to receive a call on a local SA number , plus the monthly number fee ($1.50 for a local number) . So from a pure availability standpoint, Twilio is fully operational in SA.
    
- **VAPI in South Africa:** VAPI itself is a cloud service that you access over the internet – it doesn’t provide phone numbers or PSTN connectivity by itself. Instead, you connect VAPI to phone networks via **SIP trunking**. The good news is VAPI is **carrier-neutral and global**. It has been tested by users in many regions (including Africa via internet) thanks to Daily.co’s global network. There is nothing inherent in VAPI that would prevent it from working in South Africa; it’s all about choosing a telephony integration that can get calls from SA users into VAPI’s cloud with minimal latency. VAPI's docs provide guides for integrating a variety of SIP providers: Twilio itself, but also **[Telnyx](Telnyx%20SIP%20Integration%20for%20South%20Africa.md), Plivo, and custom SIP** endpoints . In fact, you can even hook up an on-premise Asterisk/FreePBX or a service like 3CX directly to VAPI via SIP URI . This means you **absolutely can bring your own SIP trunk** to VAPI. If you have a preferred VoIP carrier in South Africa (say, one that offers cheap local call rates or an existing PBX with PSTN access), you can connect it to VAPI. VAPI will provide a SIP URI (e.g. sip:youragent@sip.vapi.ai) and you direct your trunk to send calls there . Likewise, for outbound, VAPI can route the call out via your trunk by configuring the trunk’s SIP credentials in VAPI . This **BYO telephony** approach is one of VAPI’s strengths – it decouples the AI from the telephony costs.
    

  

**Cost considerations:** Given that you suspect costs might be prohibitive, using your own SIP trunk could indeed save money. Twilio’s per-minute rates, if not using local routing, can be high. Using Twilio **with** BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier) is also an option: Twilio actually has a BYOC trunking feature where they charge a small fee (~$0.004/min) to bridge a call to an external carrier . For example, you could have Twilio dial out via your local South African SIP trunk; Twilio would only bill the bridging at fractions of a cent, and your trunk provider would bill the call at local rates. This is somewhat complex but feasible (Twilio’s SIP Interface allows outbound calls to SIP URIs and inbound from SIP with low fees ). However, if you're going to manage a separate SIP trunk anyway, you might not need Twilio in the mix at all for telephony – you could connect that trunk _directly to VAPI_, as VAPI's guides illustrate for [Telnyx](Telnyx%20SIP%20Integration%20for%20South%20Africa.md), Plivo, etc. For instance, **[Telnyx](Telnyx%20SIP%20Integration%20for%20South%20Africa.md)** has a presence in Africa and very competitive pricing; VAPI's integration with Telnyx lets you set up separate trunks for each country to optimize routing . You could create a Telnyx SIP trunk focused on South Africa (as their docs suggest, one trunk per country for best performance ). Telnyx's call rates to SA are likely much lower than Twilio's default. By combining Telnyx + VAPI, you’d pay Telnyx for minutes (and maybe a small fee to VAPI for usage of their platform – not sure VAPI’s pricing, presumably usage-based or SaaS fee) but avoid Twilio’s voice charges.

  

**Summary of BYO Trunk:** **Yes, you can bring your own SIP trunk with VAPI** – it’s a core design feature. VAPI explicitly supports custom SIP trunk integration (even multiple providers at once) . This means you can use a local VoIP carrier in South Africa to carry the calls, which likely reduces latency (since the call media can stay within SA until it hits the internet backbone) and certainly can reduce cost (local call rates vs Twilio’s markup). Just as an example, if you have an office PBX with free minutes or a bulk SIP contract, you could route calls from it into VAPI to let the AI handle the conversation – effectively offloading the “brain” to VAPI but keeping the “body” (telecom leg) under your control.

  

**Twilio vs VAPI cost:** If you stick entirely with Twilio (for both AI and telephony), the cost will include Twilio’s voice minutes plus any charges for the AI features (transcription, etc.). Twilio’s real-time transcription is about $0.027/min , and the GPT-4 usage might be charged via OpenAI or Twilio’s platform fee. VAPI’s cost model likely charges for AI minutes and possibly a platform fee, but you avoid any additional per-minute telephony cost if using your own trunk (beyond what your carrier charges). If scale is large, those minute fees add up, so BYO trunk can be a big cost saver. _In South Africa especially_, as seen, Twilio’s default $0.47/min is not viable, but their $0.03 local route is better – still, other providers might do $0.01 or less.

  

One more angle: Twilio recently announced **WhatsApp Business Calling** going GA . If your hot leads could be engaged via WhatsApp (voice call through WhatsApp), Twilio can now facilitate that. It’s not exactly relevant to SIP trunk, but it’s another channel. WhatsApp voice could bypass PSTN costs entirely (just data) and still use Twilio’s AI. However, that assumes the user is a WhatsApp contact and initiates or accepts a WhatsApp call, which may not align with “cold calling a lead on their phone.” Still, it’s interesting for future because WhatsApp is popular in South Africa.

  

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

  

**VAPI vs Twilio – which to choose?** Both platforms have their pros and cons:

- **Latency:** VAPI is generally ahead in ultra-low latency performance, thanks to its specialized real-time stack . If minimizing delay is the top priority (to make the AI feel truly human on calls), VAPI provides the cutting edge. Twilio’s latency is very good with the new streaming LLM integration, but anecdotal evidence suggests it can still be slightly higher, especially if not using an optimal setup .
    
- **South African Dialect Support:** Both are capable. Twilio has built-in support for SA English (Polly Ayanda voice, Deepgram/Google STT) , which is convenient – minimal config needed to sound local. VAPI gives you full control to use the best models for SA (Deepgram, etc.) . If you have the expertise, you might squeeze out more accuracy by customizing models with VAPI. But if not, Twilio’s defaults will work well enough for English dialect handling.
    
- **Telephony and Cost:** If you already have or can set up a **SIP trunk in South Africa**, VAPI will let you integrate that easily . This can dramatically cut costs and potentially latency (one less hop). Twilio also supports bring-your-own-carrier (via Elastic SIP trunking and SIP Interface) , but part of Twilio’s appeal is using their carrier network – which you pay a premium for. For a high volume of outbound **sales calls**, per-minute fees matter. VAPI’s model of separating the AI from the carrier gives you more flexibility to optimize price. You could even use multiple carriers: e.g., one trunk for SA, another for other countries, all feeding into the same VAPI agent – the platform was designed to scale to “millions of calls” across regions .
    
- **Ease of Development:** Twilio might be quicker to get started if you’re already familiar with Twilio’s APIs. You can buy a number, write a TwiML script or use their Node SDK to wire ConversationRelay, and you have a working AI agent on a call. VAPI, while not overly complex, introduces a new API and requires configuration of trunks, plus handling the AI logic (either via their templates or coding with their SDK). VAPI does have an array of templates and even no-code integration (e.g., guides for Zapier, Make.com, etc.) , so it’s not too low-level – but it is another system to learn. If your team is comfortable with experimenting, VAPI offers more flexibility and potentially performance. If you prefer a more **managed solution**, Twilio might be preferable, since Twilio will manage the call, the media, and even provides UI tools (Twilio Flex integration, etc., if you want to hand off to a live agent seamlessly with transcripts and sentiment analysis ).
    

  

For the **“hot lead calling” scenario (outbound sales calls by an AI agent)**, a possible strategy is: **use VAPI with a local SIP trunk**. This would maximize call quality and minimize delay for recipients in South Africa, and keep costs low by using local call rates. You’d use OpenAI’s real-time LLM through VAPI (bring your OpenAI API key) so the dialogue quality is on par with Twilio’s, and select a high-quality SA voice for TTS. The result should be an AI agent that calls leads, speaks in a South African accent, responds almost instantly, and can handle the conversation flow to schedule appointments or answer FAQs. If implementing that is within your team’s capability, it could give the best experience.

  

On the other hand, if you value the convenience of Twilio’s ecosystem – for example, if you want to quickly integrate the call recordings, summaries or pass the call into a Twilio Flex contact center when needed – then Twilio’s AI agent might make integration easier. Twilio even has features like **“AI Handoff”** where if the bot needs to hand the call to a human agent, it can pass along a summary and sentiment analysis to the agent in Twilio Flex . Those surrounding features could sway the decision if your project needs them.

  

In conclusion, **VAPI does work in South Africa** (the platform itself is globally accessible, and you can tie it into South African telephony via SIP) and **supports bring-your-own SIP trunk** for cost optimization . Twilio's new AI voice agent is also available in South Africa (with local numbers and even WhatsApp calling) and has made great strides in latency and natural language support using OpenAI's real-time GPT-4 . Both can utilize _South African English_ effectively – Twilio through its built-in language support and voices , and VAPI through custom model integration (e.g., Deepgram STT tuned for SA, and Polly or ElevenLabs voices for SA accent) .

For comprehensive details on implementing a cost-effective SIP trunk solution for South Africa, see our dedicated [Telnyx SIP Integration guide](Telnyx%20SIP%20Integration%20for%20South%20Africa.md), which provides up to 96% cost savings compared to traditional carrier rates.

  

Given your priorities (fast, natural-sounding AI voice that works well with South African English, and keeping call costs manageable), you might lean toward **VAPI for the performance and cost flexibility**, _provided_ you’re comfortable with the integration effort. If you do go with Twilio, make sure to leverage their **“Twilio-ZA” local routing** to keep costs down , and configure the ConversationRelay to use advanced speech models (Deepgram/Google) for best understanding of accents . Also choose the Polly Ayanda voice or similar for an authentic local sound . Twilio’s solution will likely get you to a working state faster, whereas VAPI might achieve a more optimal end result. Either way, it’s exciting that these technologies have evolved to a point where an AI voice agent _can_ call a lead and converse naturally – and with South African dialect support, your customers/leads may not even realize they’re speaking to an AI.
