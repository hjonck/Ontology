# **Meta-Framework Integration for AI-Native Development - Project Context**

## **Mission Statement**

Design and architect a unified meta-framework that synthesizes the **Zachman Framework's reification paradigm**, **Capability Maturity Model (CMM) progression**, and **AI-native semantic ontology methodology** into a cohesive, impedance-matched software development framework that scales seamlessly from micro proof-of-concepts to enterprise-scale, long-lifecycle projects, with integrated **canonical semantic ontological maturity** for systematic context window optimization and knowledge impedance matching.

## **Vision**

Create the world's first **AI-native software development methodology** that provides:
- **Systematic reification** from abstract strategic concepts to concrete implementations
- **Maturity-based progression** enabling teams to evolve from ad-hoc to optimized AI-augmented development
- **Universal scalability** supporting projects from 1-day POCs to multi-year enterprise initiatives
- **Semantic precision** that maximizes AI agent effectiveness while maintaining human comprehension
- **Context window optimization** through systematic semantic ontological maturity progression (35-85%+ token efficiency)
- **Knowledge impedance matching** for role-specific context optimization and cross-session knowledge evolution
